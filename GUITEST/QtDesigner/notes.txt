1. Compile ui file 

    Save your form to a .ui file, e.g. sample.ui
    
    uic -o sample.h sample.ui
    
    from a command shell
    sample.h then contains the generated source code

2. Generate .pro file

    qmake -project
    qmake

3. In the .pro file add the following 
    QT+= widgets
    HEADERS     = sample.h


4. How to include in main 

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QApplication theApp (argc, argv);
        QMainWindow widget;
        Ui::OpcodeGenerator ui;
        ui.setupUi(&widget);

        widget.show();
        return theApp.exec();
    }

5. make


ERRORS 1
    undefined reference to 'vtable 
SOLUTION 1
    

    Any time you add a new call to the Q_OBJECT macro, you need to run qmake again. 
    The vtables issue you're referring to is directly related to that.
    Just run qmake and you should be good to go assuming there are no other issues in your code.
    Add Header file too.
